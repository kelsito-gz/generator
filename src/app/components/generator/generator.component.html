    <mat-label class="paragraph">A <span class="bold">pseudorandom number generator</span> is a deterministic number generator that is based on the initial values of a seed.
        It is an algorithm that generates numbers between 0 and 1 based on a mathematical formula and the input values dictate how uniform the entered values will be.
        The numbers does not includes the 1.
        The <span class="bold">entered values </span> require a study to be able to find the ones that generate the best results, but there are certain rules to try to comply with for this.
        For example the additive constant must be prime relative to the modulator.
        The multiplicative constant is created from k, in the relation 4*k + 1.<br><br>
        <span class="bold">The formula used are this ones:</span> <br>
        <span class="bold">Lineal:</span> Xi+1 = (ai * Xi + c)(mod m),<br>
        <span class="bold">Multiplicative</span>: Xi+1 = (ai * Xi)(mod m),<br>
        <span class="bold">Language</span>: It is generated by the programming language using the current clock as a seed.<br><br>
        There is an analysis to <span class="bold">check if the generator works correctly</span> with a certain degree of confidence, this analysis is called goodness and fit test.
        For it to work correctly, it is required that more than 30 numbers be generated and through a certain degree of significance a generator can be rejected or not.
        This does not mean that the generator is approved, it is only that the hypothesis that it is a correct pseudo-random number generator is not rejected.
        The level of significance used in this system to reject a hypothesis of a generator is 5%. Which means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting a generator when it shouldn't be rejected.<br><br>
        To generate numbers outside of a uniform distribution, the inverse transform method is used to obtain the formulas needed to generate different distributions.
        The distributions that can be generated are based on the following formulas:<br>
        <span class="bold">Uniform [a,b) :</span> X = RND(b - a) + a <br>
        <span class="bold">Negative exponential :</span> X = Ln(1 - RND)/-λ <br>
        <span class="bold">Normal (Box Muller):</span> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Z1 = √(-2*ln(1-RNDi)) * sen(2π RNDi+1)</li>
            <li>Z2 = √(-2*ln(1-RNDi)) * cos(2π RNDi+1)</li>
        </ul>
